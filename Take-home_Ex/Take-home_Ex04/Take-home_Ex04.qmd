# 1. Overview

## 1.1 Setting the Scene for This Take Home Exercise

For this take-home assignment, weare tasked with choosing a module from our proposed Shiny application and accomplishing the tasks listed below:

1.  Assess and identify the required R packages for our Shiny application, ensuring they are available on CRAN,
2.  Develop and verify the specific R codes to ensure they execute properly and yield the anticipated results,
3.  Identify the parameters and outputs that will be made available through the Shiny application,
4.  Choose suitable Shiny UI components for displaying the parameters identified previously.

For this Take-home Exercise 4, we be asked to create a module report similar in content to one of the aforementioned prototype [modules](https://habaritanzania.netlify.app/). However, there will be a few key differences:

1.  Your module report for Take-home Exercise 4 must be published on your own coursework page, serving as your submission for this assignment.
2.  You must include a section titled "UI Design," detailing the different components of the user interface for your proposed design.
3.  For guidance on storyboarding the UI Design, please refer to the provided Storyboard [link](https://giniceseah.netlify.app/posts/2021-07-31-storyboard/).

# 2. Getting Started

## 2.1 Loading Necessary R packages

We will utilise the following packages:

-   ggiraph for making 'ggplot' graphics interactive.

-   plotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.

-   DT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.

-   tidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.

-   patchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.

-   ggthemes is an R package that offers additional themes, geoms, and scales for 'ggplot2'

The code which loads the R packages:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, 
               patchwork, DT, tidyverse, dplyr, ggthemes, readxl) 
```

## 2.2 Import dataset

Of course our next step involves importing the dataset. Our project revolves around electricity consumption in Singapore. This data can be retrieved from [EMA](https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/singapore-energy-statistics/chapter3) and this excel file contains many sheets.

I will be using the tidy dataset and will be importing sheet T3.4.

The following code snippet will outline the sequential steps we will undertake:

```{r}
house_ec <- read_excel("data/SES_Public_2023_tidy.xlsx", sheet = "T3.4")
```

# 3 EDA

## 3.1 EDA: Household Electricity Consumption Trend from 2005 - 2023

Firstly, we want to find out the electricity consumption trend across the years.

```{r}
filtered_house_ec <- house_ec %>%
  filter(year >= 2005, year <= 2023, month == "Annual", DWELLING_TYPE == "Overall")
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=filtered_house_ec, 
            aes(x = year,
                y = consumption_GWh)) +
  geom_point(size=1) +
  geom_line() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(2005,2023),
                  ylim=c(0,9000)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Consumption (GWh)", title = "Annual Household Electiricty Consumption from 2005 to 2023")

ggplotly(p)
```

## 3.2 EDA: Public vs Private Housing

```{r}
filtered_ec <- house_ec %>%
  filter(year >= 2005, year <= 2023, 
         month == "Annual", 
         DWELLING_TYPE %in% c("Public Housing", "Private Housing"))
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=filtered_ec, 
            aes(x = year,
                y = consumption_GWh, colour = DWELLING_TYPE)) +
  geom_point(size=1) +
  geom_line() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(2005,2023),
                  ylim=c(0,9000)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Consumption (GWh)", title = "Public vs Private Housing: Annual Household Electiricty Consumption from 2005 to 2023")

ggplotly(p)
```

## 3.3 EDA: Different Dwelling Types

```{r}
filtered_dwelling_ec <- house_ec %>%
  filter(year >= 2005, year <= 2023, 
         month == "Annual", 
         DWELLING_TYPE %in% c("1-room / 2-room", "3-room", "4-room", "5-room and Executive", "Private Apartments and Condominiums", "Landed Properties"))
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=filtered_dwelling_ec, 
            aes(x = year,
                y = consumption_GWh, colour = DWELLING_TYPE)) +
  geom_point(size=1) +
  geom_line() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(2005,2023),
                  ylim=c(60,2500)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Consumption (GWh)", title = "Public vs Private Housing: Annual Household Electiricty Consumption from 2005 to 2023")

ggplotly(p)
```
