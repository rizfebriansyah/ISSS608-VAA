A cleaner code have been compiled below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Explanation\n\n\n\nIn the R code below, we begin by selecting specific columns of interest from the dataset stu_qqq_SG. Following this, we will calculate the row means for math, science and reading scores, providing a more comprehensive measure of individual performance. The column names are then renamed to enhance clarity. Afterwards, a subset of columns is selected for focused analysis, which includes gender, socioeconomic status (escs), and educational level (school). Gender and school variables are recoded to more interpretable factors, replacing numeric codes with meaningful and easier to understand labels. The cleaned dataset, named stu_qqq_SG_2, is saved in an RDS file for future use. The RDS file is subsequently read back into the script.\n\n\n\n# Step 1: Select relevant columns\nstu_qqq_SG_1 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG %&gt;%\n  select(ST004D01T, EXPECEDU, PV1MATH, PV2MATH, PV3MATH, PV4MATH, PV5MATH, PV6MATH, PV7MATH, PV8MATH, PV9MATH, PV10MATH, PV1SCIE, PV2SCIE, PV3SCIE, PV4SCIE, PV5SCIE, PV6SCIE, PV7SCIE, PV8SCIE, PV9SCIE, PV10SCIE, PV1READ, PV2READ, PV3READ, PV4READ, PV5READ, PV6READ, PV7READ, PV8READ, PV9READ, PV10READ, ESCS)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate row means for math, science, and reading\nstu_qqq_SG_1 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG_1 %&gt;%\n  mutate(maths = rowMeans(across(c(PV1MATH, PV2MATH, PV3MATH, PV4MATH, PV5MATH, PV6MATH, PV7MATH, PV8MATH, PV9MATH, PV10MATH))),\n         science = rowMeans(across(c(PV1SCIE, PV2SCIE, PV3SCIE, PV4SCIE, PV5SCIE, PV6SCIE, PV7SCIE, PV8SCIE, PV9SCIE, PV10SCIE))),\n         reading = rowMeans(across(c(PV1READ, PV2READ, PV3READ, PV4READ, PV5READ, PV6READ, PV7READ, PV8READ, PV9READ, PV10READ))))\n\n# Step 3: Rename columns for clarity\nstu_qqq_SG_1 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG_1 %&gt;%\n  rename(gender = ST004D01T, escs = ESCS, school = EXPECEDU)\n\n# Step 4: Select specific columns for further analysis\nstu_qqq_SG_2 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG_1 %&gt;%\n  select(gender, escs, school, maths, science, reading)\n\n# Step 5: Recode gender and school columns\nstu_qqq_SG_2 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG_2 %&gt;%\n  mutate(gender = ifelse(gender == \"1\", \"Female\", \"Male\"),\n         school = case_when(\n           school == \"2\" ~ \"Lower Sec\",\n           school == \"3\" ~ \"Upper Sec\",\n           school == \"5\" ~ \"Post Sec\",\n           school == \"6\" ~ \"Diploma\",\n           school == \"7\" ~ \"Degree\",\n           school == \"8\" ~ \"Masters\",\n           school == \"9\" ~ \"PhD\"\n         ))\n\n# Step 6: Write the cleaned data to an RDS file\nwrite_rds(stu_qqq_SG_2, \"data/stu_qqq_SG_2.rds\")\n\n# Step 7: Read the cleaned data from the RDS file\nstu_qqq_SG_2 &lt;- read_rds(\"data/stu_qqq_SG_2.rds\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Explanation - as.factor() function\n\n\n\nMoving on, the provided code transforms the ‘gender’ and ‘school’ columns in the R data frame stu_qqq_SG_2 into factors using the as.factor() function. This conversion is beneficial when dealing with categorical variables, as factors in R provide a structured representation of such data. The gender factor represents two categories, “Male” and “Female,” while the school factor likely denotes different levels of education, such as “Lower Sec,” “Upper Sec,” and others. Converting these columns to factors ensures that R recognises and treats them appropriately as categorical variables during statistical analysis, allowing for better representation and interpretation of the data. Subsequently, a summary statistics report is generated, offering a quick overview of the of the cleaned dataset.\n\n\n\n# Step 1: Converting gender and school into factors (categorical variables)\nstu_qqq_SG_2$gender &lt;- as.factor(stu_qqq_SG_2$gender)\n\nstu_qqq_SG_2$school &lt;- as.factor(stu_qqq_SG_2$school)\n\n# Step 2: Display summary statistics\nsummary(stu_qqq_SG_2)\n\n    gender          escs              school         maths      \n Female:3248   Min.   :-3.5488   Degree  :2062   Min.   :262.6  \n Male  :3358   1st Qu.:-0.2327   Diploma :1299   1st Qu.:506.2  \n               Median : 0.4817   Masters :1289   Median :582.4  \n               Mean   : 0.2904   PhD     :1045   Mean   :574.0  \n               3rd Qu.: 0.9036   Post Sec: 406   3rd Qu.:648.4  \n               Max.   : 3.2780   (Other) : 296   Max.   :842.7  \n               NA's   :47        NA's    : 209                  \n    science         reading     \n Min.   :242.0   Min.   :158.6  \n 1st Qu.:498.9   1st Qu.:477.4  \n Median :571.2   Median :553.6  \n Mean   :561.0   Mean   :542.5  \n 3rd Qu.:629.3   3rd Qu.:616.1  \n Max.   :801.9   Max.   :797.6"

Therefore, it may not always start at 0, especially if there are no values in the data near 0.\nFor the x-axis, which represents the actual data points, it is often a good practice to start at 0 if it makes sense for the data. However, in our case, for socioeconomic status or indices like PISA, which can have negative values and often do not start at 0, it may be more appropriate to start at the minimum value of the data or a meaningful reference point that provides context."

This is particularly challenging for individuals with colour vision deficiencies.\nLegend Positioning: The legend is positioned inside the plot area, which can potentially cover some of the data and reduce readability.\nBins: With a bin width set to produce 20 bins, some detail in the distribution may be lost, especially if the range of math scores is broad.\n\n\n\nCritique - Aesthetics\n\nColour Saturation: The colours are very saturated, which can be visually overwhelming and make it harder to focus on the data.\nGridlines: The absence of horizontal gridlines can make it hard to estimate the number of students for a given bin.\nBar Borders: The grey borders on the bars add visual clutter, especially where colours are similar.\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Remake\nTo improve the histogram in terms of clarity and aesthetics,\n\n\nRemake - Clarity\n\nSwitch to Faceted Plot: Instead of stacking, use faceted histograms or side-by-side histograms to compare distributions between schools without overlap.\nSimplify Colour Palette: Use a simpler colour palette with fewer colours or shades to help distinguish between schools, or use patterns instead of colours for differentiation.\nReposition Legend: Move the legend outside the plot area, such as to the bottom or side, to avoid obscuring the data.\n\n\n\nRemake - Aesthetics\n\nWe use a theme with a cleaner aesthetic, such as theme_minimal(), which provides a white background and less intrusive gridlines.\nRemove Bar Borders: We need to eliminate the borders or use a softer colour that does not compete with the fill colour.\nAdd Horizontal Gridlines: We need to include soft horizontal gridlines for easier comparison of heights across the histogram.\n\n\n# Create the histogram with improvements mentioned above\nggplot(data = stu_qqq_SG_2, aes(x = maths, fill = school)) +\n  geom_histogram(position = \"dodge\", bins = 20, color = NA) +  # Use 'position = dodge' to place bars side by side\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Pastel1\") +  # Use a pastel colour palette for better distinction\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths Scores by Expected School\") +\n  labs(x = \"Math Score\", y = \"Number of Students\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # Cleaner theme\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",  # Move legend to the bottom\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"grey80\", size = 0.5),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        legend.box.background = element_rect(color = \"white\"))  # Add a background to the legend box\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this code, position = \"dodge\" is used to place the bars side by side instead of stacking them, which greatly improves clarity when comparing between schools. A pastel colour palette from scale_fill_brewer() is used to distinguish the schools while being less visually overwhelming. The legend is moved to the bottom of the plot to avoid obscuring any data."

    "text": "3.5 Boxplot between Gender and Maths Scores\n\n3.5.1 Original Design\nA boxplot below is used to reveal the distribution between maths score and Gender.\n\n\n3.5.2 Critique\n\n\nCritique - Clarity\n\nMean Indication: The red dot indicating the mean is a good addition for showing central tendency, but there is no legend explaining what the red dot signifies. Viewers might not realise it represents the mean math score.\nAxis Labels: While the y-axis is labeled, it could be more descriptive. Instead of “Maths Score,” a label like “Math Score Distribution” might provide more context.\nGender Labeling: The x-axis labels “Female” and “Male” could be more inclusive. The plot does not account for non-binary or other gender identities, which might be relevant depending on the context of the data.\n\n\n\nCritique - Aesthetics\n\nColour Scheme: The use of red for the mean is visually effective, but the rest of the plot is quite monochrome. Utilising a subtle colour for the boxes could improve visual appeal.\nPlot Spacing: The spacing between the two boxplots is quite large, which may not be an efficient use of space.\nGridlines: There are no horizontal gridlines, which can help viewers better estimate the values of the quartiles and the mean.\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Remake\nTo improve the boxplot in terms of clarity and aesthetics,\n\n\nRemake - Clarity\n\nLegend for Mean: Add a legend or annotation to explain the red dot represents the mean.\nAdditional Statistics: Add more summary statistics, such as the median (which the boxplot inherently shows), using different point shapes or colours to provide a fuller picture of the distribution.\n\n\n\nRemake - Aesthetics\n\nColour for Boxes: Introduce a light colour fill within the boxes to enhance visual differentiation between the quartiles and the overall distribution.\nReduce Width: Decrease the width of the individual boxplots to bring them closer together and use space more efficiently.\nGridlines: Add horizontal gridlines for better readability of values.\n\n\n# Enhanced boxplot with additional statistics and legends\nggplot(data = stu_qqq_SG_2, aes(x = gender, y = maths)) +    \n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = gender)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#EBF5FB\", \"#FEF9E7\")) + # Subtle colours for the boxes\n  geom_point(stat = \"summary\", aes(color = \"Mean\"), fun.y = \"mean\", size = 4) +\n  geom_point(stat = \"summary\", aes(color = \"Median\"), fun.y = \"median\", size = 4, shape = 18) +\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot of Math Score by Gender\") +\n  labs(y = \"Math Score Distribution\", x = \"\", color = \"Summary Statistics\") + # More descriptive y-axis label, remove x-axis label\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Mean\" = \"red\", \"Median\" = \"blue\")) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.title.align = 0.5,\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"grey80\", size = 0.5), # Add y gridlines\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() # Flip the coordinates into horizontal position\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis code adds subtle colours to the boxplot fills, differentiates between the mean and median with different colours and shapes, and adds y-axis gridlines for better readability.

    "text": "2.5 Preparing Subjects Data\nIn order to assess students’ performance in various subjects, including Mathematics, Reading and Science, we must identify the columns that correspond to these specific subjects.\nWith reference to PISA website, we can utilise plausible estimates for assessing student proficiency. PISA evaluates student achievement using plausible values (PVs), derived from Item Response Theory models (refer to Chapter 5 of the PISA Data Analysis Manual: SAS or SPSS, Second Edition, or the accompanying guide “Scaling of Cognitive Data and Use of Students Performance Estimates” for detailed information). These models fundamentally deduce a student’s ability from their test performance. In application, plausible values are produced through multiple imputations, considering pupils’ responses to the randomly assigned subset of test questions and their input in background questionnaires.\n\n2.5.1 Preparing Maths Data\nAfter looking through the dataset, we have determined that the columns denoting Mathematics performance are PV1MATH to PV10MATH.\nConsequently, we will compute the average of these plausible values using the rowMeans() function. A new column, called MATHEMATICS, will be generated to store the calculated average plausible values for the Mathematics subject.\nThe corresponding code snippet is as follows:\n\n# Select the columns containing math plausible values\nmath_columns &lt;- stu_qqq_SG[, c(\"PV1MATH\", \"PV2MATH\", \"PV3MATH\", \"PV4MATH\", \"PV5MATH\", \"PV6MATH\", \"PV7MATH\", \"PV8MATH\", \"PV9MATH\", \"PV10MATH\")]\n\n# Calculate the row-wise mean\nmath_row_means &lt;- rowMeans(math_columns)\n\n# Add the row means as a new column to the data frame\nstu_qqq_SG$MATHEMATICS &lt;- math_row_means\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Preparing Reading Data\nSimilarly, upon close examination of the dataset, we have identified that the columns associated with Reading are PV1READ to PV10READ.\nAs a result, we will calculate the average of these plausible values using the rowMeans() function. A new column, labeled READING, will be created to store the resulting average plausible values for the Reading subject.\nThe corresponding code snippet is provided below:\n\n# Select the columns containing read plausible values\nreading_columns &lt;- stu_qqq_SG[, c(\"PV1READ\", \"PV2READ\", \"PV3READ\", \"PV4READ\", \"PV5READ\", \"PV6READ\", \"PV7READ\", \"PV8READ\", \"PV9READ\", \"PV10READ\")]\n\n# Calculate the row-wise mean\nreading_row_means &lt;- rowMeans(reading_columns)\n\n# Add the row means as a new column to the data frame\nstu_qqq_SG$READING &lt;- reading_row_means\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Preparing Science Data\nLastly, upon a thorough review of the dataset, we have determined that the columns corresponding to Science are PV1SCIE to PV10SCIE.\nConsequently, we will use the rowMeans() function to compute the average of these plausible values. A new column, named SCIENCE, will be established to store the resulting average plausible values for the Science subject.\nThe corresponding code snippet is provided below:\n\n# Select the columns containing science plausible values\nscience_columns &lt;- stu_qqq_SG[, c(\"PV1SCIE\", \"PV2SCIE\", \"PV3SCIE\", \"PV4SCIE\", \"PV5SCIE\", \"PV6SCIE\", \"PV7SCIE\", \"PV8SCIE\", \"PV9SCIE\", \"PV10SCIE\")]\n\n# Calculate the row-wise mean\nscience_row_means &lt;- rowMeans(science_columns)\n\n# Add the row means as a new column to the data frame\nstu_qqq_SG$SCIENCE &lt;- science_row_means"

According to the PISA questionnaire manual, 1 corresponds to female, while 2 corresponds to male.\nTo facilitate a more straightforward analysis, we intend to recode the values, assigning 1 to represent female and 2 to represent male. This recoding process will be carried out using the dplyr, a component of the tidyverse package.\nWe prefer generating a new column instead of altering the current one. To achieve this, employ the mutate function in conjunction with the assignment operator (=) to establish a fresh column.\nThis action will introduce a column named ‘GENDER’ into your ‘stu_qqq_SG’ dataset, with values redefined according to the ‘ST004D01T’ column.

    "text": "2.7 Preparing Socioeconomic Status Data\nWith reference to the PISA 2022 Technical Report, Figure 5.1 in the PISA 2022 Technical Report illustrates the two-dimensional framework taxonomy. The primary dimension categorises proposed constructs into two overarching categories defined by the PISA Governing Board (PGB): domain-specific constructs and general constructs, with the latter encompassing Economic, Social and Cultural Status (ESCS). The secondary dimension further categorises proposed constructs into five categories based on key areas of educational policy setting at different levels of aggregation. These categories include Student Background, Student Beliefs, Attitudes, Feelings. and Behaviours, Teaching Practices and Learning Opportunities, School Practices, Policies, and Infrastructure, and Governance, System-Level Policies, and Practices.\nTherefore, it can be inferred that the ‘ESCS’ column can be utilised for assessing the socioeconomic status of students.\nIf we view the ‘ESCS’ column, there are negative and positive ESCS values, it generally implies a relative positioning of students along a spectrum of economic, social and cultural advantages or disadvantages.\n\nPositive ESCS value: This typically indicates a higher socioeconomic status, suggesting that the student comes from an environment with more favourable economic conditions, higher social standing, and a richer cultural background. Students with positive ESCS values may have access to more resources, educational support and opportunities.\nNegative ESCS value: Conversely, a negative ESCS value suggests a lower socioeconomic status. Students with negative ESCS values may face economic challenges, have a lower social standing, and possibly experience a less enriched cultural environment. These students may encounter additional obstacles in their educational journey due to a lack of resources or support.\n\nThe first 10 rows of the ESCS column can be seen here:\n\nThe outputThe code\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 1\n      ESCS\n     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  0.184 \n 2  0.826 \n 3 -1.04  \n 4 -0.961 \n 5  0.0856\n 6  0.127 \n 7 -0.0154\n 8  1.16  \n 9  1.47  \n10  0.520 \n\n\n\n\n\nhead(stu_qqq_SG[c(\"ESCS\")],10)"

This is specifically designed for merging separate ggplot2 graphs into a unified figure. The red dotted line indicates the mean.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram presented above offers a visual representation of the distribution of scores across three academic subjects: MATHEMATICS, READING and SCIENCE. The distribution pattern observed for each subject strongly aligns with the characteristics of a normal distribution.\nA normal distribution is characterised by a symmetrical bell-shaped curve, with the majority of data points clustering around the mean and gradually tapering off towards the extremes. In the context of academic performance, this implies that a significant proportion of students scored close to the average, while fewer students achieved scores either significantly above or below the mean. In the case of academic assessments, a normal distribution suggests that the difficulty level of the questions was appropriately balanced, allowing for a diverse range of scores among the students.\n\n\n3.1.2 Reading vs Mathematics\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=stu_qqq_SG, \n       aes(x= READING, \n           y=MATHEMATICS)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(150,850),\n                  ylim=c(150,850))\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot depicted above illustrates a positive correlation between reading and mathematics values. As the reading values increase, so do the corresponding mathematics values. This relationship is further emphasised by the upward trend observed in the best fit line. The consistent increase in one variable is mirrored by a proportional increase in the other. In light of these findings, it can be confidently asserted that a positive connection exists, suggesting that engaging in reading contributes to enhanced performance in mathematics among students."

    "text": "3.2 “Reading” as our main focus\nWith reference to this research paper titled ‘Reading matters more than mathematics in science learning: an analysis of the relationship between student achievement in reading, mathematics, and science’ by Yuanze Zhu, the results revealed that proficiency in reading and mathematics strongly correlated with science achievement, with reading exerting a more substantial influence than mathematics. Consequently, we assert that prioritising reading over mathematics is essential for enhanced performance in science learning.\nHenceforth, our focus will be exclusively on reading, considering it as the primary driver for improved achievement in other subjects, including Mathematics and Science.\n\n3.2.1 Reading vs Gender\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=stu_qqq_SG, \n       aes(y = READING, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(stat=\"summary\",        \n             fun.y=\"mean\",           \n             colour =\"red\",          \n             size=2)      \n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to the Reading, females exhibit a higher average performance compared to their male counterparts. The visual representation underscores a clear distinction, suggesting that, on average, females outperform males in the domain of Reading. One plausible interpretation for this observed trend could be rooted in the varying learning styles or preferences between genders. Research has suggested that females may, on average, possess certain cognitive strengths or approaches that align more closely with the skills demanded in Reading tasks. Additionally, sociocultural factors and educational environments may play a role in shaping differential outcomes, influencing how males and females engage with and excel in Reading-related activities.\n\n\n3.2.2 Reading vs Socioeconomic Status (ESCS)\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=stu_qqq_SG, \n       aes(x= READING, y=ESCS)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\nExamining the scatterplot above, it becomes evident that within the reading value range of 200-400, there is minimal correlation with ESCS. During this range, ESCS values exhibit considerable variability, ranging from -3 to 3. However, as reading values surpass 400, ESCS values predominantly hover around 0 and above, indicating a positive relationship. In other words, higher reading values correspond to higher ESCS values. This positive association is further emphasised by the upward trend observed in the best-fit line.\n\n\n3.2.3 Reading vs School ID\nGiven the extensive size of the dataset, our strategy is to concentrate on the top 5 schools that exhibit the highest frequency. Achieving this involves tallying the occurrences of School IDs in the CNTSCHID column.\nTo obtain the counts of each unique CNTSCHID value in descending order, we can use the table() function along with sorting functions.\n\nThe codeThe output\n\n\n\n# Our dataframe is named stu_qqq_SG and the column is CNTSCHID\nschid_counts &lt;- table(stu_qqq_SG$CNTSCHID)\n\n# Convert the result to a data frame and sort in descending order\nschid_counts_df &lt;- as.data.frame(schid_counts)\nschid_counts_df &lt;- schid_counts_df[order(-schid_counts_df$Freq), ]\n\n# Print or use the schid_counts_df as needed\nprint(schid_counts_df)\n\n\n\n\n\n        Var1 Freq\n20  70200020   60\n75  70200075   60\n158 70200159   59\n13  70200013   58\n45  70200045   58\n66  70200066   58\n141 70200141   58\n12  70200012   57\n40  70200040   57\n62  70200062   57\n105 70200105   57\n110 70200110   57\n118 70200118   57\n132 70200132   57\n4   70200004   56\n11  70200011   56\n26  70200026   56\n31  70200031   56\n35  70200035   56\n49  70200049   56\n67  70200067   56\n71  70200071   56\n82  70200082   56\n94  70200094   56\n130 70200130   56\n1   70200001   55\n44  70200044   55\n52  70200052   55\n111 70200111   55\n142 70200142   55\n145 70200145   55\n154 70200155   55\n27  70200027   54\n43  70200043   54\n119 70200119   54\n139 70200139   54\n18  70200018   52\n114 70200114   51\n38  70200038   40\n90  70200090   40\n112 70200112   40\n128 70200128   40\n150 70200151   40\n161 70200162   40\n17  70200017   39\n19  70200019   39\n29  70200029   39\n53  70200053   39\n59  70200059   39\n61  70200061   39\n63  70200063   39\n65  70200065   39\n68  70200068   39\n84  70200084   39\n104 70200104   39\n106 70200106   39\n131 70200131   39\n137 70200137   39\n164 70200165   39\n2   70200002   38\n5   70200005   38\n7   70200007   38\n8   70200008   38\n25  70200025   38\n36  70200036   38\n64  70200064   38\n73  70200073   38\n92  70200092   38\n93  70200093   38\n116 70200116   38\n126 70200126   38\n134 70200134   38\n140 70200140   38\n146 70200146   38\n151 70200152   38\n16  70200016   37\n21  70200021   37\n22  70200022   37\n32  70200032   37\n39  70200039   37\n42  70200042   37\n46  70200046   37\n47  70200047   37\n74  70200074   37\n76  70200076   37\n80  70200080   37\n85  70200085   37\n86  70200086   37\n87  70200087   37\n108 70200108   37\n117 70200117   37\n120 70200120   37\n121 70200121   37\n127 70200127   37\n135 70200135   37\n136 70200136   37\n144 70200144   37\n152 70200153   37\n155 70200156   37\n162 70200163   37\n163 70200164   37\n3   70200003   36\n6   70200006   36\n9   70200009   36\n10  70200010   36\n14  70200014   36\n24  70200024   36\n34  70200034   36\n37  70200037   36\n48  70200048   36\n51  70200051   36\n54  70200054   36\n58  70200058   36\n70  70200070   36\n81  70200081   36\n83  70200083   36\n88  70200088   36\n89  70200089   36\n96  70200096   36\n99  70200099   36\n102 70200102   36\n103 70200103   36\n109 70200109   36\n122 70200122   36\n125 70200125   36\n129 70200129   36\n143 70200143   36\n159 70200160   36\n160 70200161   36\n23  70200023   35\n55  70200055   35\n77  70200077   35\n91  70200091   35\n97  70200097   35\n101 70200101   35\n107 70200107   35\n133 70200133   35\n153 70200154   35\n15  70200015   34\n72  70200072   34\n98  70200098   34\n100 70200100   34\n113 70200113   34\n156 70200157   34\n33  70200033   33\n56  70200056   33\n69  70200069   33\n115 70200115   33\n123 70200123   32\n124 70200124   32\n79  70200079   31\n148 70200148   31\n30  70200030   30\n50  70200050   30\n147 70200147   30\n60  70200060   29\n157 70200158   29\n57  70200057   28\n95  70200095   28\n149 70200149   28\n28  70200028   22\n78  70200078   22\n138 70200138   15\n41  70200041    5\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the output, we can see that the top 5 School IDs are:\n\n70200020\n70200075\n70200159\n70200013\n70200045\n\nTherefore, we will only focus on the above mentioned School IDs for our analysis.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Filter the data for specific values of CNTSCHID\nfiltered_data &lt;- stu_qqq_SG %&gt;%\n  filter(CNTSCHID %in% c(70200020, 70200075, 70200159, 70200013, 70200045))\n\n# Convert CNTSCHID to factor\nfiltered_data$CNTSCHID &lt;- as.factor(filtered_data$CNTSCHID)\n\n# Create the plot with the filtered data\nggplot(data = filtered_data, \n       aes(y = READING, x = CNTSCHID)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(stat = \"summary\",        \n             fun.y = \"mean\",           \n             colour = \"red\",          \n             size = 2)\n\n\n\n\nUpon a detailed analysis of the boxplot, which visually encapsulates the distribution of Reading plausible values across multiple schools (identified by CNTSCHID), a distinct trend emerges.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10.\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor."

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document. Warning: This will bring in all of Bootstrap!."

    "text": "4.1.1 Basic concepts of animation\nIn the process of crafting animations, the plot itself remains static. Instead, numerous individual plots are constructed and subsequently assembled into sequences resembling movie frames, akin to the traditional method used in flip books or cartoons. Each frame represents a distinct plot capturing motion, constructed from a pertinent subset of the aggregated data. The interconnected frames, when combined, create the animated flow driven by the selected data subsets."

    "text": "4.1.2 Terminology\nPrior to delving into the procedures for generating an animated statistical graph, it is crucial to familiarise ourselves with key concepts and terminology associated with this form of visualisation.\n\nFrame: Within an animated line graph, each frame corresponds to a distinct time point or category. As the frame transitions, the data points on the graph dynamically adjust to reflect the updated data.\nAnimation Attributes: These attributes encompass the settings dictating the behavior of the animation. For instance, one can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function facilitating transitions between frames, and whether the animation should commence from the current frame or from the outset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPrior to embarking on the creation of animated graphs, it is essential to consider whether the effort is justified. For exploratory data analysis, investing time in animated graphics might not be warranted. However, in a presentation setting, strategically incorporating a few well-designed animated graphics can significantly enhance the audience’s connection with your topic compared to static alternatives."

    "text": "5.3.3 Unpacking the Bayes Factor\n\nA Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10.\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor."

The column names are then renamed to enhance clarity. Afterwards, a subset of columns is selected for focused analysis, which includes gender, socioeconomic status (escs), and educational level (school). Gender and school variables are recoded to more interpretable factors, replacing numeric codes with meaningful and easier to understand labels. The cleaned dataset, named stu_qqq_SG_2, is saved in an RDS file for future use. The RDS file is subsequently read back into the script.\n\n\n\n# Step 1: Select relevant columns\nstu_qqq_SG_1 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG %&gt;%\n  select(ST004D01T, EXPECEDU, PV1MATH, PV2MATH, PV3MATH, PV4MATH, PV5MATH, PV6MATH, PV7MATH, PV8MATH, PV9MATH, PV10MATH, PV1SCIE, PV2SCIE, PV3SCIE, PV4SCIE, PV5SCIE, PV6SCIE, PV7SCIE, PV8SCIE, PV9SCIE, PV10SCIE, PV1READ, PV2READ, PV3READ, PV4READ, PV5READ, PV6READ, PV7READ, PV8READ, PV9READ, PV10READ, ESCS)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate row means for math, science, and reading\nstu_qqq_SG_1 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG_1 %&gt;%\n  mutate(maths = rowMeans(across(c(PV1MATH, PV2MATH, PV3MATH, PV4MATH, PV5MATH, PV6MATH, PV7MATH, PV8MATH, PV9MATH, PV10MATH))),\n         science = rowMeans(across(c(PV1SCIE, PV2SCIE, PV3SCIE, PV4SCIE, PV5SCIE, PV6SCIE, PV7SCIE, PV8SCIE, PV9SCIE, PV10SCIE))),\n         reading = rowMeans(across(c(PV1READ, PV2READ, PV3READ, PV4READ, PV5READ, PV6READ, PV7READ, PV8READ, PV9READ, PV10READ))))\n\n# Step 3: Rename columns for clarity\nstu_qqq_SG_1 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG_1 %&gt;%\n  rename(gender = ST004D01T, escs = ESCS, school = EXPECEDU)\n\n# Step 4: Select specific columns for further analysis\nstu_qqq_SG_2 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG_1 %&gt;%\n  select(gender, escs, school, maths, science, reading)\n\n# Step 5: Recode gender and school columns\nstu_qqq_SG_2 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG_2 %&gt;%\n  mutate(gender = ifelse(gender == \"1\", \"Female\", \"Male\"),\n         school = case_when(\n           school == \"2\" ~ \"Lower Sec\",\n           school == \"3\" ~ \"Upper Sec\",\n           school == \"5\" ~ \"Post Sec\",\n           school == \"6\" ~ \"Diploma\",\n           school == \"7\" ~ \"Degree\",\n           school == \"8\" ~ \"Masters\",\n           school == \"9\" ~ \"PhD\"\n         ))\n\n# Step 6: Write the cleaned data to an RDS file\nwrite_rds(stu_qqq_SG_2, \"data/stu_qqq_SG_2.rds\")\n\n# Step 7: Read the cleaned data from the RDS file\nstu_qqq_SG_2 &lt;- read_rds(\"data/stu_qqq_SG_2.rds\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Explanation - as.factor() function\n\n\n\nMoving on, the provided code transforms the ‘gender’ and ‘school’ columns in the R data frame stu_qqq_SG_2 into factors using the as.factor() function. This conversion is beneficial when dealing with categorical variables, as factors in R provide a structured representation of such data. The gender factor represents two categories, “Male” and “Female,” while the school factor likely denotes different levels of education, such as “Lower Sec,” “Upper Sec,” and others. Converting these columns to factors ensures that R recognises and treats them appropriately as categorical variables during statistical analysis, allowing for better representation and interpretation of the data. Subsequently, a summary statistics report is generated, offering a quick overview of the of the cleaned dataset.\n\n\n\n# Step 1: Converting gender and school into factors (categorical variables)\nstu_qqq_SG_2$gender &lt;- as.factor(stu_qqq_SG_2$gender)\n\nstu_qqq_SG_2$school &lt;- as.factor(stu_qqq_SG_2$school)\n\n# Step 2: Display summary statistics\nsummary(stu_qqq_SG_2)\n\n    gender          escs              school         maths      \n Female:3248   Min.   :-3.5488   Degree  :2062   Min.   :262.6  \n Male  :3358   1st Qu.:-0.2327   Diploma :1299   1st Qu.:506.2  \n               Median : 0.4817   Masters :1289   Median :582.4  \n               Mean   : 0.2904   PhD     :1045   Mean   :574.0  \n               3rd Qu.: 0.9036   Post Sec: 406   3rd Qu.:648.4  \n               Max.   : 3.2780   (Other) : 296   Max.   :842.7  \n               NA's   :47        NA's    : 209                  \n    science         reading     \n Min.   :242.0   Min.   :158.6  \n 1st Qu.:498.9   1st Qu.:477.4  \n Median :571.2   Median :553.6  \n Mean   :561.0   Mean   :542.5  \n 3rd Qu.:629.3   3rd Qu.:616.1  \n Max.   :801.9   Max.   :797.6"

However, more neutral colours could be used.\nThe plot indicates skewness, but without the actual data points or additional statistical annotations, it is difficult to validate the findings stated about the skewness or the comparative peaks of the distribution.\nThe x-axis is well labeled, but the y-axis is not labeled at all, which could lead to confusion about what the density values represent.\n\n\n\nCritique - Aesthetics\n\nThe colours are easily distinguishable but as mentioned earlier, may not be the best choice due to potential gender stereotyping.\nThe default grey background and grid might not be the most aesthetically pleasing. A cleaner look might be achieved with a white background and less prominent grid lines.\nThe density lines are quite thin. Increasing their thickness could make them stand out more clearly against the background.\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Remake\nTo improve the density plot in terms of clarity and aesthetics,\n\n\nRemake - Clarity\n\nAdding annotations for mean, median or mode for each gender could provide more context.\nIf the lines are overlapping significantly, consider using fill with alpha to differentiate the distributions while showing overlap.\n\n\n\nRemake - Aesthetics\n\nIn terms ot theme, we are using theme_minimal() for a more modern, clean aesthetic.\nFor colour palette, we will opt for a colourblind-friendly palette or more neutral tones.\nWe will also increase the line thickness for better visibility.\n\n\n# Calculate mean for each gender\nstats &lt;- stu_qqq_SG_2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(gender) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean = mean(escs, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Create the density plot with annotations for mean \nggplot(data = stu_qqq_SG_2, aes(x = escs, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) + # Use fill with transparency instead of color for lines\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1f77b4\", \"#ff7f0e\")) + # Example of a colourblind-friendly palette\n  geom_vline(data = stats, aes(xintercept = mean, color = gender), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Socioeconomic Status by Gender\") +\n  labs(x = \"Socioeconomic Status - PISA Index\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) + # A cleaner theme\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\", # Position the legend on top\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n        legend.title = element_blank()) + # Remove the legend title\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#1f77b4\", \"#ff7f0e\"))  # Match line colours to the fill colours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn density plots, the y-axis represents the density of the data, which is a function of the number of observations and the bin width used in the kernel density estimation. Therefore, it may not always start at 0, especially if there are no values in the data near 0.\nFor the x-axis, which represents the actual data points, it is often a good practice to start at 0 if it makes sense for the data. However, in our case, for socioeconomic status or indices like PISA, which can have negative values and often do not start at 0, it may be more appropriate to start at the minimum value of the data or a meaningful reference point that provides context."

This is particularly challenging for individuals with colour vision deficiencies.\nLegend Positioning: The legend is positioned inside the plot area, which can potentially cover some of the data and reduce readability.\nBins: With a bin width set to produce 20 bins, some detail in the distribution may be lost, especially if the range of math scores is broad.\n\n\n\nCritique - Aesthetics\n\nColour Saturation: The colours are very saturated, which can be visually overwhelming and make it harder to focus on the data.\nGridlines: The absence of horizontal gridlines can make it hard to estimate the number of students for a given bin.\nBar Borders: The grey borders on the bars add visual clutter, especially where colours are similar.\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Remake\nTo improve the histogram in terms of clarity and aesthetics,\n\n\nRemake - Clarity\n\nSwitch to Faceted Plot: Instead of stacking, use faceted histograms or side-by-side histograms to compare distributions between schools without overlap.\nSimplify Colour Palette: Use a simpler colour palette with fewer colours or shades to help distinguish between schools, or use patterns instead of colours for differentiation.\nReposition Legend: Move the legend outside the plot area, such as to the bottom or side, to avoid obscuring the data.\n\n\n\nRemake - Aesthetics\n\nWe use a theme with a cleaner aesthetic, such as theme_minimal(), which provides a white background and less intrusive gridlines.\nRemove Bar Borders: We need to eliminate the borders or use a softer colour that does not compete with the fill colour.\nAdd Horizontal Gridlines: We need to include soft horizontal gridlines for easier comparison of heights across the histogram.\n\n\n# Create the histogram with improvements mentioned above\nggplot(data = stu_qqq_SG_2, aes(x = maths, fill = school)) +\n  geom_histogram(position = \"dodge\", bins = 20, color = NA) +  # Use 'position = dodge' to place bars side by side\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Pastel1\") +  # Use a pastel colour palette for better distinction\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths Scores by Expected School\") +\n  labs(x = \"Math Score\", y = \"Number of Students\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # Cleaner theme\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",  # Move legend to the bottom\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"grey80\", size = 0.5),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        legend.box.background = element_rect(color = \"white\"))  # Add a background to the legend box\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this code, position = \"dodge\" is used to place the bars side by side instead of stacking them, which greatly improves clarity when comparing between schools. A pastel colour palette from scale_fill_brewer() is used to distinguish the schools while being less visually overwhelming. The legend is moved to the bottom of the plot to avoid obscuring any data."

    "text": "3.5 Boxplot between Gender and Maths Scores\n\n3.5.1 Original Design\nA boxplot below is used to reveal the distribution between maths score and Gender.\n\n\n3.5.2 Critique\n\n\nCritique - Clarity\n\nMean Indication: The red dot indicating the mean is a good addition for showing central tendency, but there is no legend explaining what the red dot signifies. Viewers might not realise it represents the mean math score.\nAxis Labels: While the y-axis is labeled, it could be more descriptive. Instead of “Maths Score,” a label like “Math Score Distribution” might provide more context.\nGender Labeling: The x-axis labels “Female” and “Male” could be more inclusive. The plot does not account for non-binary or other gender identities, which might be relevant depending on the context of the data.\n\n\n\nCritique - Aesthetics\n\nColour Scheme: The use of red for the mean is visually effective, but the rest of the plot is quite monochrome. Utilising a subtle colour for the boxes could improve visual appeal.\nPlot Spacing: The spacing between the two boxplots is quite large, which may not be an efficient use of space.\nGridlines: There are no horizontal gridlines, which can help viewers better estimate the values of the quartiles and the mean.\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Remake\nTo improve the boxplot in terms of clarity and aesthetics,\n\n\nRemake - Clarity\n\nLegend for Mean: Add a legend or annotation to explain the red dot represents the mean.\nAdditional Statistics: Add more summary statistics, such as the median (which the boxplot inherently shows), using different point shapes or colours to provide a fuller picture of the distribution.\n\n\n\nRemake - Aesthetics\n\nColour for Boxes: Introduce a light colour fill within the boxes to enhance visual differentiation between the quartiles and the overall distribution.\nReduce Width: Decrease the width of the individual boxplots to bring them closer together and use space more efficiently.\nGridlines: Add horizontal gridlines for better readability of values.\n\n\n# Enhanced boxplot with additional statistics and legends\nggplot(data = stu_qqq_SG_2, aes(x = gender, y = maths)) +    \n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = gender)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#EBF5FB\", \"#FEF9E7\")) + # Subtle colours for the boxes\n  geom_point(stat = \"summary\", aes(color = \"Mean\"), fun.y = \"mean\", size = 4) +\n  geom_point(stat = \"summary\", aes(color = \"Median\"), fun.y = \"median\", size = 4, shape = 18) +\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot of Math Score by Gender\") +\n  labs(y = \"Math Score Distribution\", x = \"\", color = \"Summary Statistics\") + # More descriptive y-axis label, remove x-axis label\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Mean\" = \"red\", \"Median\" = \"blue\")) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.title.align = 0.5,\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"grey80\", size = 0.5), # Add y gridlines\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() # Flip the coordinates into horizontal position\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis code adds subtle colours to the boxplot fills, differentiates between the mean and median with different colours and shapes, and adds y-axis gridlines for better readability. The coord_flip() is included as to flip the boxplots to a horizontal orientation, which is sometimes preferred for readability."
